## Case Study

Upon completing this assessment, I was able to increase my skills in the following areas:

* Creating functional, dynamic, and reusable ReactJS components
* Field Validation
* Atomic design principles
* Responsiveness
* Code Documentation
* Live UI Documentation
* Continuous Deployment
* Git Version Control

## Project Requirements

The full breakdown for anyone interested:

1. Must use either React JS or React Native to complete the project
2. Must build and run in either a web browser or device simulator
3. May use third party libraries to complete this task
4. Organize your component into atoms, molecules and one singular organism in a way that shows you have a good understanding of atomic design principles and reuse
5. The component will have 4 responsive breakpoints as shown in Sketch file:
    * Mobile
    * Tablet Portrait
    * Tablet Landscape
    * Desktop
6. The component will have 5 states:
    * Email address collection
    * Email address collection with error message
    * Full name collection
    * Full name collection with error message
    * Congratulations! message
7. Form validation will be as follows:
    * Email Address field: Required and must be valid email
    * First Name field: Required
    * Last Name field: Required
8. Component will not change states while invalid fields exist
9. Form will not actually POST anywhere. Just console log the object that holds {email, first, last } values and toggle to ‘congratulations’ state.
10. Use Storybook to create an interactive documentation guide for:
    * Each form state
    * Each reusable component
    * Each reusable container
